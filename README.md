# CNN-image-classification-AI-or-Real-art

This project is Convolution Neural Network classfication which predicts whether the given image is AI or Real art 

Results:

Training dataset accuracy: 72%
Test dataset accuracy: 65.41%

I tried tweaking different hyper parameters but it did not improve, it may be due less data
I had only 69 images for training and 30 images to test.
